# Star Wars Battlefront 3 Mod V.1.01
A mod for GMOD that aims to recreate Pandemic's Battlefront 3. Link to concept footage/gameplay https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dml2L7vGvIw&feature=youtu.be
This mod currently merges several other mods, as well as using some original code. The next mod version will use original code and be simpler.
Currently, this mod is heavily bugged and WIP but it serves as a concept for what I will build from scratch. Huge thanks to

Star Wars Battlefront 3 Mod


As a kid, I loved seeing the leaked footage from this game. I thought BF3 was going to be the greatest game of all time.
However, it never released, at least not in the form I wanted. DICE has done an amazing job on their series, but personally
it's not my Battlefront. 

The goal of this mod is to recreate Pandemic's battlefront 3. I will be rebuilding the mod from scratch,and being patient/careful to avoid the problems that V.1
has. 

Battlefront 3 Goals


  Classic battlefront battles with space to ground(First Map, Kashyyyk)
  Clone Wars and Galatic Civil War Era
  MANY HEROES!!!
  Galactic Conquest
  
Potential Ideas


  Story Mode?
  Hunt Mode?
  Killstreaks?
